Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an example and how it might help.

Answer:
Data science encompasses leveraging computational and statistical techniques to uncover trends and patterns in existing data. It is a interdisciplinary science that allows us to dive deeper into the relationships of how data and features of importance change over time. Like so, data science has applications in almost every field of study. One example, is that data science can play a crucial role in analyzing stock number and predicting investment decisions in the world of finance. As stock prices are quantitative (numerical) data over a long period of time, and so we can use this ample amount of historical data to identify patterns and trends in how stock price change over time and what external factors might influence its change. This can lead to major contributions in other specializations like asset management and optimizing trading strategies that can ultimately help businesses make profit. Like so, data science enhances decision-making processes in finance by providing deeper insights and more reliable predictions based on complex data sets.
