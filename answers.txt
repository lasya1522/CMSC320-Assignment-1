Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: 
People use git for many reasons, but it is mainly used to manage and collaborate on code for projects. Git comes with many 
features such as its version control, which allows for users to easily revert to older versions of their code, repositories, 
which allows for users to create and store various projects, and branches, which allows for users to better organize the 
project by maintaining separate lines of development. Additionally, git allows users to push and pull changes so that members of a team can easily edit project code and share their progress with the rest of the team.
